# Racing on a Budget: How the F1 Cost Cap Reshaped Competition (2018–2023)

## Project Overview
This project investigates whether the 2021 Formula 1 budget cap has reduced competitive disparities between high-, mid-, and low-budget teams.  
Using publicly available data, statistical analysis, and AI-enhanced insights, I test the hypothesis that financial regulation has leveled the playing field.

## AI Usage

I used AI tools (mainly ChatGPT) as an **analytical assistant**, not a replacement for my own reasoning.  

### How AI Enhanced My Analysis

1. **Hypothesis Formation**  
   - Helped me frame *Red Bull’s post-cap dominance* as a formal hypothesis: **outlier dominance**  
   - Refined my null hypothesis: *Budget cap has no impact on performance disparity*  

2. **Translation into Jargon**  
   - Turned simple observations into technical phrasing  
     - Example: *“Big teams still win despite equal budgets”* →  
       *“Budget convergence did not result in performance convergence — a sign of legacy infrastructure advantages.”*  

3. **Visualization Insights**  
   - Suggested interpreting skew as *“a right-tail where a few small teams scored more points post-cap.”*
  
AI was used to **check assumptions, refine hypotheses, and improve explanations**. AI suggestions were **validated and integrated responsibly**

## Limitations
- Small sample: **3 pre-cap and 3 post-cap seasons** → low statistical power  
- Financials: Non-UK team budgets are **estimated**, introducing uncertainty  
- Exclusions: Driver salaries, marketing, and infrastructure costs are **outside the cap**, sustaining hidden inequality
